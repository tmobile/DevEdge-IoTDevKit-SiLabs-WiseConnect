# WLAN HTTP/HTTPS BT A2DP

## 1. Purpose / Scope

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the simultaneous data transfer from the radios, BT/WIFI of silabs module .

In this application, Silabs module will connect to remote server and downloads the text file from PC acting as Server.

In parallel to WLAN download, BT A2DP audio streaming is executed.

Here Silabs module will make A2DP and AVRCP level connections with remote device and transfer the PCM data to remote device in SBC encoded format.

This application provides the user with the ability to configure the individual/combined protocols.
   
## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

## 4. Application Configuration Parameters

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1** Open `rsi_common_app.h` file and configure below macros.

To enable/disable individual protocols configure below macros in **rsi_common_app.h**


```c
#define RSI_ENABLE_BT_TEST                          1 //Set this to 0 to disable BT
```

```c
#define RSI_ENABLE_WIFI_TEST                          1 //Set this to 0 to disable WLAN
```

> Note: 
> By default, all protocols are enabled.

Choose the required **operational mode** of RS9116W EVK.

```c
#define RSI_COEX_MODE                                9
```

   Valid Configurations are:

   - 0  - WLAN alone mode
   - 5  - BT alone mode
   - 9  - WLAN + BT + BLE  mode
   - 13 - BLE alone mode

```

> Note:
> BY default, when 'HTTPS_DOWNLOAD' is set, SSL and LOAD_CERTIFICATE will be set to '1' as it is required for HTTPS download.


## 5. Testing the Application

Follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with PC ](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware binary is located in `<Release_Package>/firmware/`

### 5.2 Building the Application on the NXP RT595 Host Platform


Refer getting started with IAR IDE, `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan_bt_ble/wlan_https_bt_a2dp/platforms/nxp/rt595RS9116W_with_NXP_RT595_User_Guide` 
- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan_bt_ble/wlan_https_bt_a2dp/projects/iar/wlan_https_bt_a2dp.eww`
- Build the project in IAR IDE
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from NXP RT595 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected as mentioned above, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the application steps from **5.2**

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. Open project located in "<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan_bt_ble/wlan_https_bt_a2dp/projects/iar/" and compile it using 'Make' command shown below

     ![  ](resources/readme/image20.png)
	 
2. Click on "Download and Debug" button to flash and run the application.

      ![ ](resources/readme/image21.png)
	  
      [File path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/scripts/`]

3. Copy the files 'dltestdata32.txt', 'dltest.txt' from below source path and paste in to the destination path.

   [source path: `/<Release_Package>/examples/snippets/wlan_bt_ble/wlan_https_bt_a2dp/`] 

   [destination path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/scripts/`] 
	

4. To download the files from local http server, navigate to below folder and run below command.

   [File path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/scripts/`] 

   python simple_http_server.py 80


5. To download the files from local https server, copy ssl certificates 'server-cert.pem' , 'server-key.pem' from below 'source path' and paste in to 'destination path'.

   [source path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/certificates/`] 

   [destination path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/scripts/`] 
   
     Open command prompt, navigate to above destination path and run below command.
   
   openssl s_server -accept 443 -cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem -tls1 -WWW

6. After the program gets executed, Module scans for the configured Accesspoint, connects to it and acquires the ip address

7. After acquiring ip address, initiates connection to remote server (ex: simple_http_server.py running in same network where Module is also connected)

8. If connection is successful, Module starts HTTP/HTTPS download along with below BT module start and BT inquiry operations.
	
9. If connection is not successful, step5 is repeated untill connection is success

10. While download is happening, module initiates connection to configured headset if found and streams the a2dp audio.

11. Verify that all connections are stable, no glitches in audio and also simultaneous data transfer is happening from all the radios of Module

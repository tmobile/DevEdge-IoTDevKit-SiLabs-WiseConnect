# WLAN HTTP/HTTPS BT A2DP BLE Dual Role

## 1. Purpose / Scope

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the simultaneous data transfer from all the radios (BT/BLE/WIFI) of silabs module .

In this application, Silabs module will connect to remote server and downloads the text file from PC acting as Server.

In parallel to WLAN download, BT A2DP audio streaming and 5 BLE connections/data transfers are executed.

Here Silabs module will make A2DP and AVRCP level connections with remote device and transfer the PCM data to remote device in SBC encoded format.

This application provides the user with the ability to configure the individual/combined protocols.
   
## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

## 5. Testing the Application

Follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with PC ](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware binary is located in `<Release_Package>/firmware/`

### 5.2 Building the Application on the NXP RT595 Host Platform


Refer getting started with IAR IDE, `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan_bt_ble/wlan_https_bt_a2dp_ble_dual_role/platforms/nxp/rt595RS9116W_with_NXP_RT595_User_Guide` 
- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan_bt_ble/wlan_https_bt_a2dp_ble_dual_role/projects/iar/wlan_https_bt_a2dp_ble_dual_role.eww`
- Build the project in IAR IDE
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from NXP RT595 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected as mentioned above, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the application steps from **5.2**

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. Open project located in "<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan_bt_ble/wlan_https_bt_a2dp_ble_dual_role/projects/iar/" and compile it using 'Make' command shown below

     ![  ](resources/readme/image20.png)
	 
2. Click on "Download and Debug" button to flash and run the application.

      ![ ](resources/readme/image21.png)
	  
      [File path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/scripts/`]

3. Copy the files 'dltestdata32.txt', 'dltest.txt' from below source path and paste in to the destination path.

   [source path: `/<Release_Package>/examples/snippets/wlan_bt_ble/wlan_https_bt_a2dp_ble_dual_role/`] 

   [destination path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/scripts/`] 
	

4. To download the files from local http server, navigate to below folder and run below command.

   [File path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/scripts/`] 

   python simple_http_server.py 80


5. To download the files from local https server, copy ssl certificates 'server-cert.pem' , 'server-key.pem' from below 'source path' and paste in to 'destination path'.

   [source path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/certificates/`] 

   [destination path: `/<Release_Package>/resources/scripts/`] 
   
     Open command prompt, navigate to above destination path and run below command.
   
   openssl s_server -accept 443 -cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem -tls1 -WWW

6. After the program gets executed, Module scans for the configured Accesspoint, connects to it and acquires the ip address

7. After acquiring ip address, initiates connection to remote server (ex: simple_http_server.py running in same network where Module is also connected)

8. If connection is successful, Module starts HTTP/HTTPS download along with below BT/BLE operations.

   a. BLE: Module starts advertising and scanning
   b. BT : Module starts BT inquiry
9. If connection is not successful, step5 is repeated untill connection is success

10. While download is happening, module initiates connection to configured headset if found and streams the a2dp audio.

11. To check BLE peripheral connection, scan and initiate connection from nRF connect/dongles.

12. Module accepts the BLE connections if initiated by remote BLE device(max 2 master connections are accepted) and starts data transfer based on the user configuration.

13. To check data transfer, enable Gatt notifications of Module on service characteristic "0x1AA1".

14. If enabled module continuously transmits 20 notifications per connection interval of size 20bytes.

15. To check BLE central connection, advertise the remote ble devices using phone/dongles.

16. Module scans for advertised devices, crosschecks the ble device names/ble device address as configured in application, if matches initiates connection.

17. If BLE connection is successful, Module enables the Gatt notifications of remote device for RSI_BLE_CLIENT_NOTIFICATIONS_CHAR_UUID_M1 (Heart Rate measurement) and receives notifications/connection interval.

> Note: 
> Steps 9 to 12 can be repeated for 2 peripheral connection and steps 13 to 15 can be repeated for 3 central connections based on the RSI_BLE_MAX_NBR_MASTERS and RSI_BLE_MAX_NBR_SLAVES.

18. Verify that all connections are stable, no glitches in audio and also simultaneous data transfer is happening from all the radios of Module
